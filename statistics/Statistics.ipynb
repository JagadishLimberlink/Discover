    "\n",
    "During 1970-1990, the *cassette* was a common format for prerecorded music. It consists of a magnetic tape wound around two identical rotors. The data is stored on the tape. The resulting spools rotate so as to make the tape move at a constant speed. A head (H) reads the data on the tape. Given below are pictures of an actual cassette and a schematic diagram of the same. \n",

    "Consider a cassette which has two rotors each of radius 1 cm. Initially the entire tape is wound around the left rotor. The radius of the resulting spool is 2.5 cm (as shown below). When the casette is played, the tape moves over the head at a constant speed and is wound around the right spool. Sketch the graph that shows the radius of the left spool as a function of time. \n",

Among other things, you have to decide how many cups of coffee and tea you need to prepare. Assume that there is an equal preference for both. To ensure that everybody gets the beverage of their choice, you could prepare 20 cups of coffee and 20 cups of tea. However, this will lead to a wastage of 20 cups.
