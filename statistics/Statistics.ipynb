    "During 1970-1990, the *cassette* was a common format for prerecorded music. It consists of a magnetic tape wound around two identical rotors. The data is stored on the tape. The re spools rotate so as to make the tape move at a constant speed. A head (H) reads the data on the tape. Given below are pictures of an actual cassette and a schematic diagram of the same. \n",

When the casette is played, the tape moves over the head at a constant speed and is wound around the right spool. Sketch the graph that shows the radius of the left spool as a function of time. \n",

    "Imagine picking a random number between 1 to 10 hundred times. One would expect all the ten numbers to be more or less equally distributed. Here is an experiment that has been repeated several times with similar results. When a large group of participants are asked to pick a number between 1 to 10, it is observed that the number 7 has the highest chance of getting picked and very few people pick either 1 or 10. This systematic deviation from what is considered 'random' is called _bias_. \n",

    "### Airplane shots\n",
    "This problem is based on an incident that happened during World War II. Fighter planes are always at risk of getting shot down by enemies. To reduce the chances of being destroyed planes are usually armored. The armor consists of bullet-proof shields and adds weight to the aircraft.  If there too much armor, the aircraft gets bogged down and consumes a lot of fuel. If there is too little, the plane risks being shot down. The US military was interested in finding the optimal amount of armor to protect their fighter planes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The military approached a well-known statistician named Abraham Wald for advice. They brought some data about the planes that had returned from Europe. All the planes that had returned were covered in bullet holes but the distribution of bullet holes was not uniform. The data showed the density of bullet holes on different parts of the plane:\n",

    "\n",
    "![](pics/aircraft.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The military felt that the engine was well-protected and the fuselage was the least protected. They expected Wald to give them the exact amount by which they should increase the armor on the fuselage and reduce on the other parts. But Wald looked at the data and gave them an unexpected answer. He recommended the military to *increase* the armor on the engine and reduce on the fuselage. Can you think of a rationale for this recommendation? \n",
